Contiribute.
--------

1. Image Processing 을 위한 해외 Opensource Project Library Package로 Contiributor로서 새로운 패키지를 추가.

2. Python을 이용한 Cropping 기능 구현

3. JavaScript Package를 활용한 Prototype Plugin Module 및 Import Dom script 구현.

4. Leveraging Django-Frameworks and Opensource, which is light-bootstrip-dashboard, of Visualization Page visualize T-SNE.


**History:**
  * (front) Development Annotation Platform for Web by using [Annotorious] 
   > PHP, JAVASCRIPT, AWS Service
   
  * (back) Development Crop Image Service for Python by using [PIL]
   > Python
  
  * Deepdive inference use by sagemaker, lambda, apigateway, and AWS APP
